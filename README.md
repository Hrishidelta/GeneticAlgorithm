# GeneticAlgorithm
Simple Genetic Algorithm Implementation

Aim : To take a initial set of random string with a fixed length and make it mutate and evolve over multiple generations to form "Wassup, Sunil" .

"Wassup, Sunil" is the optimal target string.

Challenge : I could evolve the fittest string with just one wrong alphabet.
